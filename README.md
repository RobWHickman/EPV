# EPV
R package to implement various Expected Possession Value models

Written by Robert Hickman, October 2019






## What is this package?

The motivating idea behind Expected Possession Value models of football events is that each action (or 'event') a player makes has some impact upon the expected final result. The simplest and most dramatic example of this is a spectacular long range drive suddenly changing the score differential. For example:

![Andros Townsend vs. Manchester City](/soccer_gifs/crystalpalace_shot_v_mancity.gif)

However, most actions are trying to progress the ball into an area where a better shot can be taken from. When in possession this is done by either passing or carrying/dribbling the ball, for example:

![Robin van Persie vs. Spain](/soccer_gifs/netherland_pass_v_spain.gif)

Or when out of possession, by pressing/tackling the opposition to win the ball back and allow a chain of passes/carries to begin.
